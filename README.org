#+title: Catconf

For when you want:
1. Runtime configuration for after the binary is compiled
2. A single file binary

This library allows for taking the final result binary, and just concatenating the configuration to the end:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cat target/debug/binary <(echo -n "CATCONF") conf > confedbinary
#+END_SRC

Great, but how to get the configuration back out and use it in the code? catconf!

It's use is pretty simple:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
use catconf::ConfReaderOptions;

let conf_reader = ConfReaderOptions::new(b"CATCONF".to_vec()).read_from_exe()?;
#+END_SRC

This returns a ~Vec<u8>~ which can be transformed further, by converting to UTF-8 and combined with Serde, decompressing with zlib, etc.
